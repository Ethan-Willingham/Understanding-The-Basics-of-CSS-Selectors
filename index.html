        <h2>Interesting Facts about Kitten Development</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The largest number of kittens born to a cat in a single litter is
            19. This record was set by a four-year-old Burmese/Siamese cat named
            Tarawood Antigone in 1970 in the UK. Out of these, 15 survived.
          </li>
          <li>
            Most cats have 18 toes, with five on their front paws and four on
            the back. However, some cats, known as polydactyl cats, can have as
            many as 28 toes in total! The Guinness World Record for the cat with
            the most toes is 28, shared by several polydactyl cats.
          </li>
          <li>
            Himmy, a desexed tabby cat from Queensland, Australia, weighed in at
            a staggering 21.3 kg (46.8 lbs) in 1986. This made Himmy the
            heaviest cat ever recorded. Since then, the Guinness World Records
            has stopped recording "heaviest pets" to discourage overfeeding.
          </li>
          <li>
            It's possible for a single litter of kittens to have multiple
            fathers. This phenomenon is known as superfecundation. If a female
            cat mates with more than one male cat while she's in heat, different
            kittens in the resulting litter can have different fathers.
